# FoE-UBQ
Code for the UBQ
This is a pretty simple code which uses pyautogui. You will have to install pyautogui, I recommend with pip.
If you are interested in using the code, you will have the most success with the file FoE_File_Remy.py.
There are step by step instructions and a setup code that I made to help guide you through using it for the first time.
All you need to do is run it once to get it setup, copy what it prints out, paste it in the correct place in the code, and run it whenever you want.
there are more instructions in the actual file
