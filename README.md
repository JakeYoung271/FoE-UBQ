# FoE-UBQ
Code for the UBQ
This is a pretty simple code which uses pyautogui. You will have to install it, I recommend with pip
Next you will have to import the class or in the same file run an object with that class and the method RunUBQ()
You can play around with the code there is some other stuff
make sure that you instantiate the class with the argument "g" I need to change it, but g is for my IA city in g-world, c is for my PE city in C world
Somethings might be off with a different display. you may have to adjust the pixel values
This code is meant to run on a splitscreen, it doesn't work with a splitscreen, Foe on the left, you may have to adjust the pixel values.
